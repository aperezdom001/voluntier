            <p> Ever since my surgery, I have become immobile. I posted on Voluntier
                about my garden needing some tending to and within 3 hours I already
                had members of the community responding to help me. I would reccommend 
                Voluntier to everyone in need of assistance!

                We needed volunteers for a charity event for our local community center! Within hours we had 
                responses and were able to fill our roster with people will to help! Thank you Voluntier!

                Our non-profit WagMoreBarkLess needed help transporting puppies from a puppy mill down south. We 
                organized our event on Voluntier and were able to find people on very short notice. Voluntier made
                finding reputable volunteers extremely easy!
